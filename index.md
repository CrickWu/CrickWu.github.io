This is just a simple blog where I write summaries about what I have read recently, either technical stuff or random chats. The construction is still under go.

I currently work at Google Cloud AI. I graduated from Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University in Aug. 2020, working with Prof. [Yiming Yang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/).
My interests include machine learning with specific stress on graph-based kernel methods, time series prediction and ML applications in general.

I used to study at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) at Tsinghua University, working with Prof. [Jianyang Zeng](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~compbio/index.html).
